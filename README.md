# RobotFightClub

This repo is for me to experiment with Unity, aiming to recreate the board game Robot Fight Club from Needy Cat Games (www.needycatgames.com).

Art and assets used are owned by and used with permission from Needy Cat Games.

You can try out the analog version of Robot Fight Club at https://www.needycatgames.com/blog/2020/3/14/build-your-own-robotfightclub and subscribe to their newsletter for information about when it will be released :)
