# RobotFightClub

## About
This repo is for me to experiment with Unity, aiming to recreate the board game Robot Fight Club from Needy Cat Games (www.needycatgames.com).

You can try out the analog version of Robot Fight Club at https://www.needycatgames.com/blog/2020/3/14/build-your-own-robotfightclub and subscribe to their newsletter for information about when it will be released :)

## Latest Changes
I'm struggling to get gRPC to connect from the Unity Client to the server, although I could get this to work from a console application. 
After some other experiments, I got SignalR working with little fuss and will continue with that instead. The next step is to interpret the instructions from the server in the Unity client.


## Approach
The aim is to recreate RFC in a mobile game that can connect two players remotely. On the way, I'll be learning about Unity and testing out some server design ideas.
